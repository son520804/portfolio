      <p>With the rise of digital learning, educators are taking inclusive teaching online. For example, a recent study from the U.S. Department of Education pinpoints that educational leaders and teachers can partner with local governments to get students connected through initiatives that increase the number of public Wi-Fi hot spots in places like libraries and other safe spaces. With access to internet, students could enhance bilingualism through online platforms, digital tools, and apps that gamify learning, supplement instruction, and provide additional exposure to languages.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Adaptive, blended learning program</button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
      <p>Adaptive, tech-enabled language learning programs allow educators to easily personalize learning for each student, based on skill and proficiency level. This type of edtech allows students to direct their own learning paths with teacher-led instruction and ongoing progress monitoring. So, bilingual students can process the content more effectively to accelerate English language learning.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Digital storytelling tool</button>
    <div class="collapsible_content">
      <p>Storytelling is an excellent, interactive learning activity for ELLs and bilingual learners of all ages and language abilities. For beginning-level English-language learners, creative projects tend to offer storytelling opportunities for low-stakes communication-based activities. At medium and upper level, create projects such as podcasting and video production can further develop student's interest in storytelling and language abilities.</p>
