					<p> People may become bilingual either by acquiring two languages at the same time in childhood or by learning a second language sometime after acquiring their first language. </p>

					<p> PBS Learning Media incorporates state standards with popular PBS educational shows. This learning platform is a great tool because teachers add content to their lesson plans based on standards. Furthermore, with videos, interactive activities, and reading passages, teachers also create crossword puzzles, quizzes, and other learning activities.</p>

			<h2>Research Teaching</h2>

			<h5 style="font-weight:700">Applied Probabilistic Data Science in Python</h5>
			<p>a Coursera MOOC specialization co-creating with Christopher Brooks, University of Michigan, School of Information</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div class="left-content">
					<h5 style="font-weight:700">Breakdown of MOOC <br> specialization:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li>Fundamentals of Bayesian Thinking</li>
						<li>Probabilistic Data Analysis: Bayesian Estimation</li>
						<li>Probabilistic AI-Assisted Technology: Bayesian Experimentation</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<p>The learning objectives of the first two courses are to explain what Bayesian thinking is and go through fundamental Bayesian estimation techniques in Python. The last course is to simulate AI-assisted toolkits including, but not limited to, online advertisement system (click through rate, conversion), MOOClet system (personalized message assigning policy), Bayesian knowledge tracing, and recommender system using coding lectures and step-guided projects.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="middle-content">
					<h5 style="font-weight:700">Step-guided Code Examples <br> and Projects</h5>
					<br>
					<p>This series of courses aim at engaging novice programmers who are new to Bayesian statistics, want to improve programming skills while learning statistics and nurture analytic mindsets. We also train conversational Bayesian programmers who will learn through industrial application the core Bayesian framework and mindset behind probability.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Currently, we have designed 50+ step-guided coding lectures and projects combined to encourage students to seamlessly interact with Bayesian models and develop experimental mindset during their studies.</p>

				<div class="right-content">
					<h5 style="font-weight:700">Student-centric Content <br>Generation: Learnersourcing</h5>
					<br>
					<p>Learnersourcing is a highly effective way to encourage high-order thinking, foster space repetition, improve student’s use of critical thinking and retrieval practice, and invite timely feedback, thus enhancing students’ motivation to engage in acquiring course-related skill sets (<a href="https://itali.uq.edu.au/resources/learning-analytics/ripple/use-cases">Learn more</a>). </p>
					<br>
					<p>In response to the <a href="http://mitros.org/p/papers/assess15.pdf">success implementation</a> of learnersourcing in MOOCs, we are currently building a learnersourcing academic communities among all students who attend the specialization. We incentivize students to create research questions, generate interesting case studies and reinterpret concepts etc. Meanwhile, each students receive other student’s work and provide peer feedback and reflection.</p>
