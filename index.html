					<p> “Bilingualism” is often used to describe people who can use two languages fluently. My teaching experience and my own experience of being a bilingual learner
						<span class="dots">...</span>
						<span class="more">
							make me have passion for exploring bilingual learners’ language and literacy development especially for those bilingual learners whose parents immigrated to another country. Some general research questions I want to further explore: 1) What factors do impact bilingual learners’ language and literacy development? I am especially interested in the impact of the home/school environment. 2) How can bilingual learners’ parents and teachers support their language and literacy development? 3) What factors do impact bilingual learners’ willingness to use their heritage language and to inherit their heritage culture?

					<p>In the 21st century, there are so many technologies supporting foreign language learning, but how many of them were specially designed for bilingual learners
						<span class="dots">...</span>
						<span class="more">
							 especially for those heritage learners. Many researchers have already pointed out that heritage learners have different learning needs with foreign language learners. The input and output of the target language and their funds of knowledge are also different. SO, how much benefits heritage learners could get from current foreign language learning tools. I am interested in exploring how to design a learning tool for supporting bilingual learners’ language and literacy development through honoring their heritage culture and maintaining their heritage language.</span></p>
