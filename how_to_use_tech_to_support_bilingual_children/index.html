      <p>In the 21st century, there are so many technologies supporting foreign language learning, but HOW MANY of them were specially designed for bilingual learners especially for those heritage learners. Many researchers have already pointed out that heritage learners have different learning needs with foreign language learners. The input and output of the target language and their funds of knowledge are also different. SO, how much benefits heritage learners could get from current foreign language learning tools. I am interested in exploring how to design and use learning tools for supporting bilingual learnersâ€™ language and literacy development through honoring their heritage culture and maintaining their heritage language.

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Virtual tools</button>
      <div class="collapsible_content">
        <p>With the rise of digital learning, educators are taking inclusive teaching online. For example, a recent study from the U.S. Department of Education pinpoints that educational leaders and teachers can partner with local governments to get students connected through initiatives that increase the number of public Wi-Fi hot spots in places like libraries and other safe spaces. With access to internet, students could enhance bilingualism through online platforms, digital tools, and apps that gamify learning, supplement instruction, and provide additional exposure to languages.</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Adaptive, blended learning program</button>
      <div class="collapsible_content">
        <p>Adaptive, tech-enabled language learning programs allow educators to easily personalize learning for each student, based on skill and proficiency level. This type of edtech allows students to direct their own learning paths with teacher-led instruction and ongoing progress monitoring. So, bilingual students can process the content more effectively to accelerate English language learning.</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Digital storytelling tool</button>
      <div class="collapsible_content">
        <p>Storytelling is an excellent, interactive learning activity for ELLs and bilingual learners of all ages and language abilities. For beginning-level English-language learners, creative projects tend to offer storytelling opportunities for low-stakes communication-based activities. At medium and upper level, create projects such as podcasting and video production can further develop student's interest in storytelling and language abilities.</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Virtual field trip</button>
      <div class="collapsible_content">
        <p>Virtual field trip with digital tool such as Google Tour Creator creates an exciting experience for immersing students in the target language and culture. Students are able to see 360-degree views of these places and read or listen to audio narration of the history behind the featured sites. This tool exposes students to the language and culture, and may inspire them to travel and use the target language in a real-life, authentic context.</p>
