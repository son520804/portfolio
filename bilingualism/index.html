      <p>“Bilingualism” is often used to describe people who can use two languages fluently. My teaching experience and my own experience of being a bilingual learner make me have passion for exploring bilingual learners’ language and literacy development especially for those bilingual learners whose parents immigrated to another country.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pros of bilingualism</button>
      <div class="collapsible_content">
        <p>Research indicates that people who speak two or more languages significantly outperform monolinguals in certain mental tasks, such as maintaining focus on important information.</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Limitation of bilingualism</button>
      <div class="collapsible_content">
        <p>Teaching academic content in two languages can be very expensive, and the prices of bilingual education programs are sky-high for most students and families. This is one reason why this education program model in its more intensive forms is typically limited to private schools.</p>
